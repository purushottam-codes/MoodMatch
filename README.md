## 📌 Overview
MoodMatch is a creative side project that evolves alongside my structured study plan.  
It suggests **3 recommendations (movies, series, short films, or songs)** based on the user’s **mood + preferred medium**, ranked by ratings and relevance.

This project demonstrates how I apply weekly learning milestones (Python, Flask, FastAPI, SQL, DevOps) to build a real-world portfolio app.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** → core logic, regex, file I/O
- **Flask / FastAPI** → web framework
- **SQLAlchemy** → database models
- **Ansible / Terraform** → deployment automation
- **APIs** → IMDb, Spotify for ratings and metadata

## 🎯 Features (Planned)
- Mood input + medium selection
- Ranked recommendations (top 3)
- User history tracking
- API integration for live ratings
- Web interface with Flask/FastAPI
- Cloud deployment with Terraform

## 📅 Weekly Progress
MoodMatch grows week by week:
- **Month 1** → Console app (basic mood → suggestions)  
- **Month 2** → Flask web app + SQL database  
- **Month 3** → API integration + automation  
- **Month 4** → FastAPI endpoints + async calls  
- **Month 5** → Cloud deployment + README polish  
- **Month 6** → Demo + interview prep  

## 🚀 Goals
- Reinforce Python + networking skills through a creative side project.  
- Build a portfolio-ready app that showcases both technical depth and originality.  
- Demonstrate initiative and problem-solving in interviews.

## 📸 Demo (Coming Soon)
Screenshots and video demo will be added in **Week 23**.
