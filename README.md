# MoodMatch
MoodMatch 🎭 is a mood‑based recommender system that suggests movies, series, short films, or songs based on user mood and preferred medium. Built alongside my 25‑week CareerBuilder journey, it evolves from a Python console app into a full‑stack project with Flask, FastAPI, SQL, and cloud deployment.
